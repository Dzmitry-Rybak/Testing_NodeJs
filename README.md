# CRUD REST API with Node.js, Express, and Jest (TDD Approach)

## Description
Learned how to build a full CRUD REST API using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Jest**, leveraging the **test-driven development (TDD)**.

### Why TDD?
TDD is becoming the standard in modern software developmentâ€”and for good reason:
- It ensures **safety and security** when making changes, minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality.
- It eliminates the need for tedious and unsustainable manual tests, especially in medium-to-large applications.
- It empowers developers to make big refactors confidently, keeping code clean and maintainable.

### What You've Learned
- Step-by-step guidance on building a REST API with **Express**.
- How to write **unit tests** and **integration tests** using the **Jest** testing framework.
- Exercises and opportunities to practice and solidify your knowledge.
